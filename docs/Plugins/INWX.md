# How To Use the INWX DNS Plugin

This plugin works against the [INWX](https://www.inwx.de/) DNS provider. It is assumed that you have already setup an account and created the DNS zone(s) you will be working against.

## Setup

There is no special setup required, as INWX uses a username and password for API authentication. However, it is recommended to [set up](https://www.inwx.de/en/account) a dedicated API sub-user for automation purposes, with only the "DNS Management" role assigned. This way, if your API credentials are compromised, only your DNS settings are at riskâ€”your domain ownership and other user accounts will remain secure.

## Using the Plugin

You will need to provide the username as String to `INWXUsername` and the password associated with the username as a SecureString value to `INWXPassword`.

```powershell
$pArgs = @{
    INWXUsername = (Read-Host "INWX API username")
    INWXPassword = (Read-Host "INWX API password" -AsSecureString)
}
New-PACertificate "example.com" -Plugin "INWX" -PluginArgs $pArgs
```

For a more automated approach (assuming you understand the risks and methods to secure the below credentials):

```powershell
$pArgs = @{
    INWXUsername = "username"
    INWXPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "password belonging to username" -AsPlainText -Force
}
New-PACertificate "example.com" -Plugin "INWX" -PluginArgs $pArgs
```

This plugin also supports [mobile TAN](https://kb.inwx.com/en-us/5-customer-details/70-what-is-the-mobile-tan-service-and-how-can-i-activate-it)-enabled accounts. If your account is secured by mobile TAN ("2FA", "two-factor authentication"), you must define the shared secret (usually presented below the QR code during mobile TAN setup) as a SecureString to `INWXSharedSecret`. This allows the plugin to generate OTP codes. The shared secret is NOT not the 6-digit code you need to enter when logging in. If you are not using 2FA, leave this parameter undefined or set it to `$null`:

```powershell
$pArgs = @{
    INWXUsername = "username"
    INWXPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "password belonging to username" -AsPlainText -Force
    INWXSharedSecret = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "2FA_SHARED_SECRET_32CHARS" -AsPlainText -Force
}
New-PACertificate "example.com" -Plugin "INWX" -PluginArgs $pArgs
```
