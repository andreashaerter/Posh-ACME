# How To Use the INWX DNS Plugin

This plugin works against the [INWX](https://www.inwx.de/) DNS provider. It is assumed that you have already setup an account and created the DNS zone(s) you will be working against.

## Setup

There is no special setup needed, as INWX uses a username and password for API authentication. However, it makes sense to set up a [dedicated API user](https://www.inwx.de/en/account) in your account with the "DNS Management" role for automation purposes. This way, nothing besides your DNS settings is at risk if your API credentials are compromisedâ€”your domain ownership and other user accounts will remain secure.

!!! note
    This plugin does not work with [mobile TAN](https://kb.inwx.com/en-us/5-customer-details/70-what-is-the-mobile-tan-service-and-how-can-i-activate-it)-enabled accounts yet.

## Using the Plugin

You will need to provide the username as String to `INWXUsername` and the password belonging to the username as a SecureString value to `INWXPassword`.

```powershell
$pArgs = @{
    INWXUsername = (Read-Host 'INWX API username')
    INWXPassword = (Read-Host 'INWX API password' -AsSecureString)
}

```
